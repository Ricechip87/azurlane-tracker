## 2026-06-04 - Flatten AzurLane Tracker Project

### Why
- `5. AzurLane` was intended to be the project root.
- The generated `azurlane-tracker` subfolder created an unnecessary nested project and nested Git repository.
- `참고용/` is a local reference-material folder and should not be tracked by Git.

### Changed
- Moved the React/Vite app files from `azurlane-tracker/` to the repository root.
- Removed the nested `azurlane-tracker` project structure from Git tracking.
- Updated `.gitignore` for root-level app artifacts and ignored `참고용/`.
- Removed the root-level source CSV from Git tracking after it was moved into `참고용/`.
- Added `PLAN.md` for development planning.
- Split `calcTechPoints` into `src/utils/techPoints.js` to satisfy React Fast Refresh lint rules.

### Verified
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
