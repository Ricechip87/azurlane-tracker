# Change Log

## 2026-06-04 - Define Product Direction

### Why
- The project direction was clarified as an ALtoy-style tool specialized for owned-ship growth and fleet optimization.
- Optional visual archive features should be distinguished from the core tracker/recommendation goals.

### Changed
- Rewrote `README.md` to describe the project identity, goals, and local commands.
- Expanded `PLAN.md` with required goals, optional goals, and a staged roadmap.

### Verified
- Documentation-only change.

## 2026-06-04 - Update Script Source Paths

### Why
- The app was moved to the repository root while source CSV files are kept locally under `참고용/`.
- Data conversion scripts needed to resolve input files from the new root project structure.

### Changed
- Updated `scripts/convert-csv.js` to read the main CSV from `참고용/`.
- Updated `scripts/add-tech-points.js` to read the tech-point CSV from `참고용/`.

### Verified
- Confirmed both referenced CSV paths exist locally.
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`

## 2026-06-04 - Flatten AzurLane Tracker Project

### Why
- `5. AzurLane` was intended to be the project root.
- The generated `azurlane-tracker` subfolder created an unnecessary nested project and nested Git repository.
- `참고용/` is a local reference-material folder and should not be tracked by Git.

### Changed
- Moved the React/Vite app files from `azurlane-tracker/` to the repository root.
- Removed the nested `azurlane-tracker` project structure from Git tracking.
- Updated `.gitignore` for root-level app artifacts and ignored `참고용/`.
- Removed the root-level source CSV from Git tracking after it was moved into `참고용/`.
- Added `PLAN.md` for development planning.
- Split `calcTechPoints` into `src/utils/techPoints.js` to satisfy React Fast Refresh lint rules.

### Verified
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npm.cmd run build`
